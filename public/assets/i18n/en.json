    "Q1_QUESTION": "Is the analysis really free? Will you spam me?",
    "Q1_ANSWER": "Yes, FytAI is 100% free. We don't ask for your email and will never spam you. No registration is required to use the service.",
    "Q2_QUESTION": "Why should I trust FytAI rather than a simple quiz?",
    "Q2_ANSWER": "Unlike classic quizzes with pre-defined answers, FytAI uses real AI that analyzes your entire profile in depth to generate a unique recommendation. Each result is created specifically for you, taking into account your physical characteristics, goals and preferences.",
    "Q3_QUESTION": "Who created FytAI? Are there doctors involved?",
    "Q3_ANSWER": "FytAI was created by a team of developers passionate about sports and technology. We don't have doctors on the team, which is why we emphasize that our recommendations don't replace professional medical advice.",
    "Q4_QUESTION": "What AI model do you use exactly?",
    "Q4_ANSWER": "We use llama-3.3-70b-versatile, a powerful language model accessed via the Groq API. It's capable of understanding context and generating coherent recommendations based on your profile.",
    "Q5_QUESTION": "Will the AI only recommend swimming and cycling?",
    "Q5_ANSWER": "No! Our system can recommend over 50 different sports: from classic sports (swimming, running, cycling) to more original activities (climbing, dance, martial arts, team sports, etc.). The recommendation really depends on your profile.",
    "Q6_QUESTION": "Has the AI been trained on medical data?",
    "Q6_ANSWER": "The AI model we use has been trained on a wide variety of texts, including health and sports content. However, it's not a specialized medical model. That's why we always recommend consulting a healthcare professional.",
    "Q7_QUESTION": "What happens to my data?",
    "Q7_ANSWER": "Your data is processed in real-time to generate your recommendation and is not stored permanently on our servers. We don't sell or share your personal information with third parties.",
    "Q8_QUESTION": "Can I trust recommendations if I have a serious medical condition?",
    "Q8_ANSWER": "No. If you have a serious medical condition (heart disease, recent surgery, severe osteoarthritis, etc.), you MUST consult a doctor before starting any physical activity. FytAI can give you ideas, but only a medical professional can validate their safety.",
    "Q9_QUESTION": "Why do you ask so many questions?",
    "Q9_ANSWER": "Each question helps the AI better understand your unique situation. The more information we have, the more accurate and personalized your recommendation will be. You can skip optional questions, but results will be less precise.",
    "Q10_QUESTION": "Can I redo the test if I'm not satisfied with the recommendation?",
    "Q10_ANSWER": "Absolutely! You can redo the analysis as many times as you want. Your answers might evolve, and you might discover different sports suited to your changing situation.",
    "Q11_QUESTION": "Are my data sold to third parties?",
    "Q11_ANSWER": "No, never. Your data is processed only to generate your recommendation and is not stored on our servers after analysis. We do not sell any data.",
    "Q12_QUESTION": "How long is my data kept?",
    "Q12_ANSWER": "Your form answers are saved locally in your browser to allow you to resume later. They are deleted as soon as you get your result. We do not keep any data on our servers.",
    "Q13_QUESTION": "Can I trust these recommendations if I have serious pathologies?",
    "Q13_ANSWER": "No, if you have serious pathologies, you must absolutely consult a doctor before starting any sports activity. FytAI is a decision support tool, not a medical diagnosis.",
    "Q14_QUESTION": "What happens if the recommended sport doesn't suit me?",
    "Q14_ANSWER": "We always provide alternatives! If the main sport doesn't suit you, explore the 3 other suggestions. You can also redo the test by adjusting your answers.",
    "HONESTY_TITLE": "Our commitment to honesty",
    "HONESTY_1": "We do not claim to have scientific or medical validation. FytAI is a technological tool, not a medical device.",
    "HONESTY_2": "Our recommendations are AI-generated and may contain errors. Use your judgment and consult professionals if necessary.",
